## Introduction
Computational NeuroscienceChennai, IndiaProf.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Department of Biotechnology, IIT MadrasAug 2017 – Nov 2017◦Implemented Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh Nagumo models on MATLAB. Observed variations in action potential whenexternal current was varied, and identified the stable and unstable points.◦Implemented CNN model for handwritten digit recognition tasks on MNIST dataset and observed weights encoding foredges and corners•Deep LearningChennai, IndiaDr.Mitesh Khapra, Computer Science Department, IIT MadrasJan 2018 – Feb 2018◦Wrote python script using NumPy library to execute feedforward and backpropagation algorithm.◦Implemented the code on Fashion MNIST dataset.  Achieved an accuracy of 92% and on the task of object classification.•Leadership WorkshopSeoul, South KoreaProf.  Yungki Kim, School of International Studies, Hanyang UniversityNov 2016 – Dec 2016◦Made a business model for a tour company conceptualizing post Korean unification scenario, as a part of LeadershipWorkshop course.◦Received the first position among 7 international teams, and secured the top grade in the course
## Attention Model for Object Detection<br>
* In this work we are focusing to implement the model which will search for the target object in the same manner as human looks at the interested object in the entire image. 


## Eye-Tracker <br>
* By analyzing eye-movement data, for example where people fixate and how long they fixate for, researchers can gain important insights into a number of cognitive operations involved in a wide range of behavior
