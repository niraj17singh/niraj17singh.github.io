## Projects
### Computational Neuroscience Chennai, India, Prof.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, Aug 2017 – Nov 2017. 
* Implemented Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh Nagumo models on MATLAB. Observed variations in action potential when external current was varied, and identified the stable and unstable points. 

* Implemented CNN model for handwritten digit recognition tasks on MNIST dataset and observed weights encoding foredges and corners. 

* Deep Learning Chennai, India, Dr.Mitesh Khapra, Computer Science Department, IIT Madras, Jan 2018 – Feb 2018. Wrote python script using NumPy library to execute feedforward and backpropagation algorithm. Implemented the code on Fashion MNIST dataset.  Achieved an accuracy of 92% and on the task of object classification.•Leadership WorkshopSeoul, South KoreaProf.  Yungki Kim, School of International Studies, Hanyang University, Nov 2016 – Dec 2016. Made a business model for a tour company conceptualizing post Korean unification scenario, as a part of Leadership Workshop course. Received the first position among 7 international teams, and secured the top grade in the course.
Modelling bio-inspired attention for traffic sign detectionChennai, India, Prof.  Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Computational Neuroscience Lab, IIT Madras, June 2018 – Present

◦Recording human gaze data, using GP3 Eye-tracker and PyGaze python library to analyze human search behaviour.

◦Using road data at two different scales to develop a bio-inspired attention model using Q-Network and reinforcement learning.
•Modelling prediction of traffic signs in road video data, Chennai, India, Prof.  Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Computational Neuroscience Lab, IIT Madras, June 2018 – May 2018

◦ Developed an end to end pipeline using CNN and Q-Network with reinforcement learning for predicting traffic signs inroad video data.

◦Demonstrated 2% increase in the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, YOLO and Faster R-CNN for trafficsign detection.

◦The project lead to a one-year research collaboration with Continental Automotive, an automotive company, for developing bio-inspired models for traffic sign in self-driving cars.

•Modelling main sign and supplementary traffic sign summarizationBangalore, India, Mr. Jitendra Kumar, Machine Learning Team, Continental Automotive, Nov 2017 – Dec 2011

◦Developed a network for image captioning and trained on multi-modal deep network with traffic sign image and text asinputs using LSTM network for summarizing road traffic signs.

◦Filed a patent for the deploying it in the next generation camera in the company.

•Reducing rejection rate of metal casting using convex optimizationChennai, India, Dr. Abhishankar Kumar, Data Science Team, Gyandata Pvt.  Ltd, June 2017 – July 2017

◦Used cvxopt library for convex optimization and PCR for optimizing the additives and returned sand properties toreduce rejection rate of metal casting in the patented SandMix and SandMan blending model.

◦Developed and deployed computational model for multi-target multi model, which reduced cost of production by 15%per metal casting.

•Developing a platform for forex tradingChennai, IndiaMr.  Thayagarajan, Trecktics Pvt.  Ltd, Jun 2017 - July 2017

◦Designed a system to populate interactive charts using data from forex trading and deal entry form, reducing timeconsumed.  Created smart contracts using Hyperledger for cross borer remittances, thus eliminated intermediaries andclearing houses.

•Study interaction between moths and pytohormonesBangalore, India, Dr.Radhika Venkatesan, National Centre for Biological Sciences, May 2015 – July 2015

◦Reared two moths:  S. litura and H.armigera, from egg to adult stage in a controlled environment.  Analyzed the effect ofphytohormones on the moths, which were fed on artificial food prepared using chickpea flour and essential vitamins.

◦Identified the lethal dose of phytohormones, which can be used to develop novel pest controls in Asian agricultural farms.
## Attention Model for Object Detection<br>
* In this work we are focusing to implement the model which will search for the target object in the same manner as human looks at the interested object in the entire image. 


## Eye-Tracker <br>
* By analyzing eye-movement data, for example where people fixate and how long they fixate for, researchers can gain important insights into a number of cognitive operations involved in a wide range of behavior
