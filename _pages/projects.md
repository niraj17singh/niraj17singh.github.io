## Projects
### Project Associate in Computational Neuroscience Lab, , Prof.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Department of Biotechnology, Chennai, India, IIT Madras, June 2018 – Present. 

### 1. Modelling bio-inspired attention for traffic sign detection, June 2018 – Present

* Recording human gaze data, using GP3 Eye-tracker and PyGaze python library to analyze human search behaviour.
* Using road data at two different scales to develop a bio-inspired attention model using Q-Network and reinforcement learning.


### 2. Modelling prediction of traffic signs in road video data, June 2018 – May 2018

* Developed an end-to-end pipeline using CNN and Q-Network with reinforcement learning for predicting traffic signs in road video data.
* Demonstrated 2% increase in the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, YOLO and Faster R-CNN for traffic sign detection.
* The project lead to a one-year research collaboration with Continental Automotive, an automotive company, for developing bio-inspired models for traffic sign in self-driving cars.


### Computational Neuroscience, Prof.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, Chennai, India, Aug 2017 – Nov 2017. 

* Implemented the code on Fashion MNIST dataset.  Achieved an accuracy of 92% and on the task of object classification.
* Implemented CNN model for handwritten digit recognition tasks on MNIST dataset and observed weights encoding for edges and corners.
* Implemented Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh Nagumo models on MATLAB. Observed variations in action potential when external current was varied, and identified the stable and unstable points. 


### Deep Learning, Dr.Mitesh Khapra, Computer Science Department, IIT Madras, Chennai, India, Jan 2018 – Feb 2018. 

* Wrote python script using NumPy library to execute feedforward and backpropagation algorithm. 


### Leadership Workshop Seoul, South Korea, Prof. Yungki Kim, School of International Studies, Hanyang University, Nov 2016 – Dec 2016. 

* Made a business model for a tour company conceptualizing post Korean unification scenario, as a part of Leadership Workshop course.
* Received the first position among 7 international teams, and secured the top grade in the course.


### National Centre for Biological Sciences, Dr.Radhika Venkatesan, Bangalore, India, May 2015 – July 2015

* Study interaction between moths and pytohormones
* Reared two moths:  S. litura and H.armigera, from egg to adult stage in a controlled environment. Analyzed the effect of phytohormones on the moths, which were fed on artificial food prepared using chickpea flour and essential vitamins.
* Identified the lethal dose of phytohormones, which can be used to develop novel pest controls in Asian agricultural farms.
