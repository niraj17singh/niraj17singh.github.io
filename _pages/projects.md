## Projects
### Computational Neuroscience, Chennai, India, Prof.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, Aug 2017 – Nov 2017. 

* Implemented the code on Fashion MNIST dataset.  Achieved an accuracy of 92% and on the task of object classification.

* Implemented CNN model for handwritten digit recognition tasks on MNIST dataset and observed weights encoding foredges and corners.

* Implemented Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh Nagumo models on MATLAB. Observed variations in action potential when external current was varied, and identified the stable and unstable points. 



### Deep Learning Chennai, India, Dr.Mitesh Khapra, Computer Science Department, IIT Madras, Jan 2018 – Feb 2018. 

* Wrote python script using NumPy library to execute feedforward and backpropagation algorithm. 


### Leadership Workshop Seoul, South Korea, Prof. Yungki Kim, School of International Studies, Hanyang University, Nov 2016 – Dec 2016. 

* Made a business model for a tour company conceptualizing post Korean unification scenario, as a part of Leadership Workshop course.

* Received the first position among 7 international teams, and secured the top grade in the course.


### Project Associate in Computational Neuroscience Lab, Department of Biotechnology, Chennai, India, IIT Madras, Prof.  V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy, June 2018 – Present. 

#### Modelling bio-inspired attention for traffic sign detection, June 2018 – Present

* Recording human gaze data, using GP3 Eye-tracker and PyGaze python library to analyze human search behaviour, June 2018 – Present.

* Using road data at two different scales to develop a bio-inspired attention model using Q-Network and reinforcement learning, June 2018 – Present.

#### Modelling prediction of traffic signs in road video data, June 2018 – May 2018

* Developed an end-to-end pipeline using CNN and Q-Network with reinforcement learning for predicting traffic signs in road video data.

* Demonstrated 2% increase in the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, YOLO and Faster R-CNN for trafficsign detection.

* The project lead to a one-year research collaboration with Continental Automotive, an automotive company, for developing bio-inspired models for traffic sign in self-driving cars.

### Continental Automotive, Bangalore, India, Mr. Jitendra Kumar, Machine Learning Team, Nov 2017 – Dec 2011

* Modelling main sign and supplementary traffic sign summarization 

* Developed a network for image captioning and trained on multi-modal deep network with traffic sign image and text as inputs using LSTM network for summarizing road traffic signs.

* Filed a patent for the deploying it in the next generation camera in the company.

### Gyandata Pvt.  Ltd, Dr. Abhishankar Kumar, Data Science Team, Chennai, India, June 2017 – July 2017

* Reducing rejection rate of metal casting using convex optimization 

* Used cvxopt library for convex optimization and PCR for optimizing the additives and returned sand properties to reduce rejection rate of metal casting in the patented SandMix and SandMan blending model.

* Developed and deployed computational model for multi-target multi model, which reduced cost of production by 15 % per metal casting.

### Trecktics Pvt.  Ltd, Mr. Thayagarajan, Chennai, India, Jun 2017 - July 2017

* Developing a platform for forex trading

* Designed a system to populate interactive charts using data from forex trading and deal entry form, reducing time consumed.  Created smart contracts using Hyperledger for cross borer remittances, thus eliminated intermediaries and clearing houses.

### National Centre for Biological Sciences, Dr.Radhika Venkatesan, Bangalore, India, May 2015 – July 2015

* Study interaction between moths and pytohormones

* Reared two moths:  S. litura and H.armigera, from egg to adult stage in a controlled environment. Analyzed the effect of phytohormones on the moths, which were fed on artificial food prepared using chickpea flour and essential vitamins.

* Identified the lethal dose of phytohormones, which can be used to develop novel pest controls in Asian agricultural farms.
